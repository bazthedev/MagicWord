# MagicWord
## A program that will prompt user to "login" upon keypress or mouse movement. If the password is incorrect, then the computer will basically lock and play the "ah ah ah, you didn't say the magic word"
## Changing the password:
### Windows:
1. Open your temp folder (Windows Key + R, then type %temp% and press ok)
2. Open the file called mw.json
3. Edit `please` (default password) to be a password of your own!
4. Save and close, now running the program will use that password!
5. Note: do not remove the "" that surround your password
